1) What is the mass of a photon?
- The mass of a Photo is 0 (zero), massless.

2) What is the size of a quark?
- The size of a quark is 10^(-18) meters.

3) What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
- Colour charge is responsible for the strong force acting on quarks and anti-quakrs, 
  Where electric charge is physical properties that cause force when experiece in magnetic field
  
4) Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion?
- Boson have force carriers particles and mesons, but fermion got leptons and quarks, and baryons. 

5) Describe what type of particle is both a boson and a hadron.  Give and example.
- Mesons (Pions, Kaons) are the example both a boson and a hadron. It is their quark and gluon constitotents that carry 
  the charge of the strong force
  
6) Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
- THe bubble chamber is use to detect electrically charged particles moving through it, by using prussure and liquids.

7) What are leptons made of?
- Leptons are said to be elementary particles; that is, they do not appear to be made up of smaller units of matter. 
  Leptons can either carry one unit of electric charge or be neutral. 
  
8) Name two leptons and two baryons.
Leptons: Charm and strange
Baryons: Proton and Neutrons

9) Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynmenn diagram.
Each vertex must conserve charge, baryon number and lepton number at a feynmann diagram, it isto describle the interactions
  in quantum electrodynamics(QED)

10) Explain what an "exchange particle" is.  Describe its function and provide an example.
- Gluons is the excharge particles example. The color force between the quarks. It can be considered to be the fundamental 
  exchange particle underlying the strong interaction between protons and neutrons in a nucleus.
